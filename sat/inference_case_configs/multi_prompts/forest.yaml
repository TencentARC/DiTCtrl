  prompts:
    - "A narrow forest path winds through towering trees shrouded in a dense fog. The mist clings to the branches, creating an ethereal atmosphere where shapes and shadows blur together. The air is moist and cool, muffling sounds and making every step feel hushed. Leaves glisten with dew, and the path ahead disappears into the fog, inviting exploration into the unknown. The forest feels mysterious and quiet, as if holding its breath."
    - "A narrow forest path winds through towering trees bathed in warm sunlight. Rays of light filter through the canopy, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air is fresh, filled with the scent of pine and wildflowers. Birds sing from the branches, and small animals scurry through the underbrush. The path is clear and inviting, leading adventurers deeper into the vibrant, lively forest. The atmosphere is peaceful and full of life."
